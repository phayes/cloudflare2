CloudFlare is a FREE reverse proxy, firewall, and global content delivery network and can be implemented without installing any server software or hardware.

What does this module do?
-------------------------
1. Corrects `$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]` so it contains the IP address of your visitor, not CloudFlare's reverse proxy server.
2. Appropriately sets `$_SERVER['HTTPS']` when CloudFlare's `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is detected.
3. Adds appropriate headers when serving the AlwaysOnline crawler
4. Integrates with CloudFlare's Threat API so you can ban and whitelist IP addresses from the Drupal Comment administration screen.
5. Integrates with CloudFlare's Spam API.
6. Integrates with CloudFlareâ€™s Client Interface API (planned).


How do I get started with CloudFlare?
-------------------------------------
1. Visit http://www.cloudflare.com to sign up for a free account.
2. Follow their 5-minute configuration wizard.
3. Install this module and configure
   A. Install and Enable this module.
   B. Assign permissions to administer module (if you are not logged in as the user 1, admin)
   C. Save your email address and CloudFlare API key to the CloudFlare administration screen on your Drupal web site (`admin/settings/cloudflare`).
   D. Configure IP address detection as instructed below


IP Address detection
--------------------

Because your site will be proxied via CloudFlare, the global variable `$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]` will contain a CloudFlare IP address, not the client IP.  There are two ways this can be corrected. 


# Default Method: Use X-Forwarded-For Headers

The CloudFlare module will automatically modify the incoming `$_SERVER["HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR"]` header to remove CloudFlare IPs from the list of possible connecting IP addresses. This means that you can use Drupal's built-in `X-Forwarded-For` header handling and evertying will "just work". There is no special configuration required for this set-up. If you are using a reverse proxy such as varnish, you can configure your `$conf['reverse_proxy_addresses']` array just as before and everything should work as expected.


# Alternative Method: Use CF-Connecting-IP header. 

CloudFlare provides a header called `CF-Connecting-IP`. We can use this header to detect the correct client IP address. When the cloudflare module is configured to use `CF-Connecting-IP` it will use this to set `$_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"]`, and disable the processing of X-Forwarded-For headers. To use this set-up, simply place this code somewhere in your `settings.php` file:

```
$conf['cloudflare_cf_connecting_ip'] = TRUE;
```


Using a reverse proxy
---------------------

If your site is behind a reverse-proxy such as varnish, you should configure your outer reverse proxy to strip incoming cloudflare specific headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `CF-Railgun`, `CF-Ray`, `CF-Visitor`, and `CF-IPCountry`) if the incoming request is not from a valid CloudFlare IP address (https://www.cloudflare.com/ips). This ensures that bad actors cannot spoof CloudFlare headers and impersonate a different connecting IP address or other information.
